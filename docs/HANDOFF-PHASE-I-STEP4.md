## 1. Architecture (ADR-018 — locked + user-confirmed 2026-05-20)

Split the CF cosigner **by compute weight**, all on Cloudflare:

| Layer | Runs on | Responsibility | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Durable Object** (wasm, `bsv-mpc-worker`) | CF Worker | Durable `share_A` (DO SQLite), per-agent isolation, relay routing, **light 1-round presigned online-sign** (issue partial) | storage ✅, light-sign ✅ proven |
| **Native** (`bsv-mpc-service`) | **CF Container** | Heavy CGGMP'24: **DKG + presignature generation** | platform ✅ proven (P1); full image = P2 |
| **Proxy** (`bsv-mpc-proxy`, native, holds `share_B`) | agent host | Initiates ceremonies; **combines** partials (holds `PresignaturePublicData`) | migration pending (I-4c) |

**Why:** `/poc/dkg-bench` (`4b30c84`) empirically proved DKG/auxinfo does **not**
fit the CF Worker CPU ceiling (~16s prime-gen, full DKG died ~35s). Light
online-sign-with-presig is pure field math → fits wasm (proven byte-identical on
the deployed isolate). So heavy=native, light=wasm. `PresignaturePublicData` is
NOT `Serialize`, but only the **combiner** (native proxy) needs it → **no
cggmp24 fork change required**; the DO ships/needs only `Presignature` (which IS
`Serialize`).

**Gotcha:** `Date.now()` is frozen during synchronous wasm compute in CF Workers
(Spectre mitigation) — benchmark with external wall-clock, not in-worker timers.

## 3. Key APIs (all in `bsv-mpc-core`)
- `SigningCoordinator::sign_with_presignature(&[u8;32], Box<dyn Any+Send>)` — the
  **proxy/combiner** path. Box = `presigning::PresignOutput`
  (`(Presignature, PresignaturePublicData)`) from `PresigningManager::take_raw()`.
- `signing::issue_partial_signature_json(presig_json, sighash) -> partial_json` —
  the **DO** path (issue only; needs only the serializable `Presignature`).
- `DkgCoordinator::set_pregenerated_primes_from_json(&str)` — seed primes (native).
- Test/bench helpers (`#[doc(hidden)]`/`#[ignore]`): `dkg::generate_test_primes`,
  `signing::tests::print_issue_partial_fixture`.
- **Base-key only for the presig path**: BRC-42 `hmac_offset` (HD-derived keys)
  keeps the 4-round `sign()` path — the offset is baked into a presig at
  generation time and `issue/combine` take no offset.

---

## 4. Remaining roadmap (integration → merge gate)

1. ~~**Presig provisioning** (task #14)~~ **✅ DONE (`d6ccf57`).** Authed
   `/ceremony/ingest-presig` stores `Presignature_A` (JSON) into the DO
   `mpc_presignatures` pool under the DO's **own** identity (handler authz);
   `/poc/presig-pool` proves provision→consume→light-sign byte-identical on the
   deployed worker. `PresignaturePublicData` stays native (never shipped).
   **REMAINING here:** the native container half — `bsv-mpc-service` must
   actually POST to `/ceremony/ingest-presig` after each presig gen (couples to
   the proxy `bridge.rs` migration, #12). The DO `consume` is wired into the
   sign loop in step 2.
2. ~~**Worker relay sign loop** (task #15, I-4b.2)~~ **✅ DONE (`c0c9fbf` +
   `5f26db9`).** `/poc/sign-relay`: DO consumes a presig → issues its partial →
   wraps it as a canonical §05 `MessageEnvelope` → dials the relay → sends to the
   recipient on box `mpc-sign` (room `{recipient}-mpc-sign`). The **deployed DO
   co-signs over the live relay → BSV-valid 2-of-2 signature** (native combiner
   harness `sign_relay_deployed_e2e.rs`, `SIGN_RELAY_E2E=1`, no sats).
   **REMAINING:** the production path is the `/poc/sign-relay` route; folding it
   into an authed, wake-on-HTTP production endpoint couples to the proxy
   `bridge.rs` migration (#12) and I-5.
3. ~~**CF Container P2** (task #17)~~ **✅ DONE (`4937955`).** Full native
   `bsv-mpc-service` deployed + `/health`-proven on CF Containers
   (`bsv-mpc-service-container.dev-a3e.workers.dev`). Root `Dockerfile` +
   `poc/cf-container-p2/`. ADR-018 native half confirmed. See
   `docs/CF-CONTAINER-PROBE.md` (P2/P3). **REMAINING:** this is a bare
   `/health`-reachable service; wiring it as the actual presig-gen driver
   (running 2-party presig gen with the proxy + POSTing to the DO's
   `/ceremony/ingest-presig`) couples to #12 + provisioning automation.
4. ~~**Proxy `bridge.rs` migration** (task #12, I-4c)~~ **✅ CORE DONE (`b29e699`).**
   `relay_sign::combine_sign_over_relay` (+ `MpcBridge::sign_over_relay`) makes the
   proxy the relay **combiner**, deployed-proven (proxy + DO → BSV-valid sig over
   the relay). **REMAINING (the OQ-I1 retirement, not yet done):** route
   `createSignature`/`createAction` through the relay path + retire the HTTP
   `bridge.rs::sign`. That final wiring needs the presig-provisioning automation
   (native Container generates a correlated pair → DO pool via `/ceremony/ingest-presig`
   AND the proxy's presign pool). Tracked with provisioning automation.
5. **🔒 #5 security must-fixes BEFORE I-5** — design `docs/AUTHZ-DESIGN.md`
   (spec-checked §07/§08). **Steps 1-2 DONE (`a518a3a`)**: caller-identity
   threading + owner-identity authz (sign/ecdh/presign reject 403 unless
   caller==DKG-time owner), 39 worker unit tests. **REMAINING:**
   - ~~**Step 3** — durable auth sessions in DO SQLite~~ **✅ DONE (`c4cc9fa`).**
     `AuthSessionStore` trait + `mpc_auth_sessions`; BRC-31 auth moved INTO the
     pinned DO (entrypoint = thin forwarder). **Deployed-proven:** session
     survives +143s isolate eviction byte-identical; no-auth → 401;
     `/poc/handshake` green; 40 worker unit tests. **Auth-session-isolate FIXED.**
   - **Step 4 (remaining)** — authed production `/sign-relay` (requester==owner,
     add to `is_authed_path`) + stable proxy identity (derive `BridgeAuth` key
     from the share file — OQ-A2 decided). Couples to the createAction-over-relay
     + presig-provisioning automation; the authed positive flow is naturally
     exercised by the I-5 path (proxy does authed BRC-31 triggers). **Gate:** the
     #12 `relay_combine_deployed_e2e` through the AUTHED route (owner accepted,
     stranger rejected).
   - Remaining #5 hardening: at-rest encryption of primes/session blobs;
     blast-radius doc; rate limiting. §08.12 BRC-52 cert verifier + §09 policy =
     richer follow-on (own issue).
6. ~~**I-5 merge gate** (task #16)~~ **✅ DONE (`61430a3`).** Real-sats mainnet
   TXID **[`d9119190…081580`](https://whatsonchain.com/tx/d9119190bc73b63bc1a84b3418df3f849d74f55dec84d879fac6fbcaaa081580)**:
   proxy (share_B) + the **deployed** worker (share_A partial over the relay)
   co-signed; pre-flight verify gated the broadcast; GorillaPool
   `SEEN_ON_NETWORK`; confirmed on WhatsOnChain. `i5_real_sats_deployed_e2e.rs`
   (`E2E_MAINNET=1`). **The Phase I deployed-cosigner merge gate is satisfied.**

## 5. GitHub state (hygiene current as of 2026-05-20)
- **Milestone:** `v1.0 — CF-native cosigner (Calhoun-side)` — issues #2, #4, #5
  assigned; #3 (Phase H) closed.
- **#2** umbrella — updated with the ADR-018 status block; Phase H ticked.
- **#4** Phase I tracker — labels `phase:I,step:implement,wire-compat,security`;
  body has a "CURRENT STATUS" block (this handoff in miniature); fund-safety gate
  ticked; Step 4 reframed per ADR-018.
- **#5** hardening backlog — labels `security,cleanup`; 1-round presig + seed-
  primes-auth items checked off; auth-session-isolate finding in comments.
- Tasks #12, #14, #15, #16, #17 track the remaining roadmap items above.

---

## 6. Native harness for the I-4b.2 / I-5 proofs
- Party-1 over relay: copy `crates/bsv-mpc-service/tests/dkg_via_messagebox_e2e.rs`
  + `sign_mainnet_via_messagebox_e2e.rs`. `MessageBoxClient` + `DkgHandler`/
  `SigningHandler`; `cggmp24`/`round_based` are dev-deps of root + service.
- BRC-31-authed HTTP to the deployed worker: replicate `bridge.rs`'s `BridgeAuth`
  handshake + per-request signing. ⚠️ Worker auth sessions are in-memory in the
  entrypoint isolate (#5) — handshake + request may hit different isolates;
  `/poc/*` routes are unauthed (the deterministic deployed proofs use those).

---

## 7. Discipline + deploy harness (carry forward)
- **110% no asterisks**: RUNTIME proof for deployed work (byte-identical / live
  TXID), not just build-clean. Native crypto changes proven by unit+vector+BSV-verify.
- Each sub-gate lands on `main` before the next; `cargo fmt --all -- --check` +
  `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` + `cargo build --target
  wasm32-unknown-unknown -p bsv-mpc-worker` before push.
- `cd ~/bsv/mpc/bsv-mpc/` (NEVER `bsv-mpc-old-unscrubbed/`). `gh auth switch -u Calgooon` to push.
- **Worker deploy:** `eval "$(grep '^export CLOUDFLARE' ~/bsv/mpc/bsv-mpc/secrets.md)"`
  then `cd crates/bsv-mpc-worker && wrangler deploy`. **worker-build self-heals to
  0.8.3** via the gitignored `wrangler.toml` build command (it intermittently
  downgrades to 0.7.5 — see memory `reference_worker_build_downgrade`).
- **Container deploy:** uses `CLOUDFLARE_CONTAINERS_TOKEN` in secrets.md (has
  Workers+Containers+UserDetails perms) as `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`. Needs Workers
  Paid + Containers open-beta (account is entitled). `cd poc/poc-cf-container &&
  wrangler deploy`.
- **secrets.md is gitignored — NEVER commit; redact `[a-f0-9]{16,}` and
  `cfut_[A-Za-z0-9]+` from all output.** Verified: no token in any tracked file.
- god-tier + full-stack: consult `~/bsv/` reference stack before fixes; swarm/
  orchestrate research, then VERIFY agent output.

**Last commit:** `61430a3` (**🔒 I-5 MERGE GATE — real-sats mainnet TXID
[`d9119190…`](https://whatsonchain.com/tx/d9119190bc73b63bc1a84b3418df3f849d74f55dec84d879fac6fbcaaa081580)**;
deployed DO + proxy co-signed a real mainnet TX over the relay). **The Phase I
deployed-cosigner merge gate is SATISFIED.** Everything ADR-018 is proven
end-to-end on real Cloudflare + real mainnet.

**Remaining (hardening + productionization, not merge-gate blockers):**
- ✅ **#5 step 4 DONE** — authed production `/sign-relay`. (1) Stable proxy key:
  `BridgeAuth::from_share_seed` derives the proxy's long-lived BRC-31 / relay
  identity deterministically (HMAC-SHA256, domain `"bsv-mpc proxy auth identity
  v1"`) from the secret share material, so the proxy keeps the same
  `owner_identity` across restarts (§07.4 / OQ-A2). (2) `/sign-relay` is now a
  BRC-31-gated production route (`is_authed_path`) with owner-authz (§08.1) that
  **consumes** a pooled presig (provisioned via authed `/ceremony/ingest-presig`)
  rather than taking it in the body — `/poc/sign-relay` retained as the
  unauthed test sibling (§07.6). `MpcBridge::sign_over_relay` auto-attaches BRC-31
  headers; `MpcBridge::provision_presig_to_do` ships `Presignature_A` authed.
  **Deployed proof** (`sign_relay_authed_deployed_e2e.rs`, `SIGN_RELAY_AUTHED_E2E=1`,
  worker version `801f92e6`): real bridge (stable identity) → authed provision →
  authed `/sign-relay` → DO consumes pooled presig → relay → proxy combines →
  **BSV-valid 2-of-2 sig (71-byte DER)**; unauthed `/sign-relay` → **401**. No
  sats. 147 proxy + 40 worker unit tests green.
- ✅ **createAction-over-relay wiring DONE** — `1b5c7ab` (pool refactor) +
  `dd8383c` (wiring). (1) `PresignManager` now holds the full
  `(Presignature, PresignaturePublicData)` box (`take_raw`) the combiner needs,
  not just the serializable `Presignature` (the box is `Send`-not-`Sync`, so it's
  `Mutex`-shimmed for `AppState: Sync`). (2) `MPC_RELAY_SIGN=1` routes base-key
  `createSignature` (hmac_offset=None) and `createAction` through the relay
  combiner (`relay_sign()` → `sign_over_relay`); HD-derived signing stays on the
  4-round HTTP path. Default off. **Deployed proof**
  (`create_signature_routes_through_relay`): base-key createSignature via the
  wallet_api entry in relay mode → deployed DO co-signs over the relay →
  root-key sig verifies (71-byte DER). No sats.
  - **Gate driver settled (user-confirmed):** the #6 mainnet gate drives the
    *running* proxy via the canonical SDK BRC-100 client
    `bsv_rs::wallet::substrates::HttpWalletJson` (default `localhost:3321`) pointed
    at the proxy (`localhost:3322`) → `create_action(CreateActionArgs)`. That IS an
    unmodified BRC-100 client — no bsv-worm, no hand-rolled JSON, Path-A.
- **Provisioning automation (#4) — REMAINING, the last piece before the gate.**
  Native Container (`bsv-mpc-service`, holds share_A, has `/presign/*`) runs
  presig gen with the proxy (`bridge.presign_raw()` targets the **container** in
  relay mode → proxy pool gets box_B), then ships its `Presignature_A` to the DO
  worker via authed `/ceremony/ingest-presig`; both pools consume FIFO in
  lockstep. Note: the DO needs only the *presignature* for the light sign
  (`issue_partial`), not share_A itself — so the container is the share_A holder
  for presig gen. Needs: container BRC-31 client + extract `Presignature_A` from
  the completed session + background replenishment loop.
- **#5 hardening** — at-rest encryption of primes/session blobs, blast-radius
  doc, rate limiting; §08.12 BRC-52 cert verifier + §09 policy (own issue).
- **Phase J/K** — CHIP discovery + cross-stack joint TX with Binary.

(historical I-5 plan, now done):
swap the e2e's test key shares for a funded DKG joint key (fund the joint
address via wallet `localhost:3321`, Origin `http://admin.com`, `E2E_MAINNET=1`),
proxy + deployed DO co-sign over the relay, broadcast, cite the TXID.
Separately, the createAction-over-relay wiring + HTTP-path retirement need
presig-provisioning automation (native Container → DO + proxy pools). The hybrid
sign path, relay transport, proxy combiner, and both deployment homes are all
proven end-to-end; crypto + transport are locked.
